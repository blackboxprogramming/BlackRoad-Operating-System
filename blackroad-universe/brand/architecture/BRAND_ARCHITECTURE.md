- **Technical but not intimidating** - Deep expertise explained clearly
- **Visionary but not hand-wavy** - Big ideas grounded in real architecture
- **Confident but not arrogant** - We know what we built, but we listen
- **Mythic but not fantasy** - We use narrative power for real outcomes

### Target Audiences (Priority Order)
1. **Enterprise Decision-Makers** - CTOs, CIOs, Chief AI Officers at regulated companies
2. **Compliance & Risk Officers** - People who need to explain AI to regulators

## Brand Dos and Don'ts

### ✅ DO:
- Use "deterministic" to differentiate from probabilistic AI
- Show the architecture, don't just claim it works
- Tell stories that reveal technical depth
- Speak to multiple audiences with tailored messages
- Use "agent" (not "bot" or "assistant")
- Reference audit trails and RoadChain for credibility
- Invoke Lucidia for warmth and wonder
- Use technical precision when appropriate

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use vague corporate buzzwords ("innovative solutions," "transformative," "synergy")
- Promise AI magic without explaining how
- Talk down to any audience
- Separate "enterprise" and "developer" into different worlds
- Hide behind jargon when clarity is needed
- Over-index on either mythic language OR dry specs
- Forget to connect every sub-brand back to BlackRoad OS
