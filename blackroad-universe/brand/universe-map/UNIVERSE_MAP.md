## 0. Core Myth

**BlackRoad** is the master brand:

> "Safe, deterministic, emotionally-aware AI infrastructure for builders and regulated worlds."

**BlackRoad OS** is the operating system:
- It orchestrates 1,000+ AI agents, each with identity, memory, lineage, and policy constraints
- Includes: PS-SHA∞ identity, RoadChain audit trails, governance & compliance, multi-model orchestration

**Lucidia** is the guide / storyteller / interface of the universe.

**ALICE QI** is the deterministic intelligence engine.

**BlackRoad QI / Quantum** is the quantitative & research brain.

**BlackRoad Network** is the dev + partner ecosystem.

**blackroad.me** is the personal identity & Pocket OS portal.

3. **Regulator-comforting, founder-exciting** - We speak both languages
4. **One universe, many doorways, one underlying OS** - Coherent constellation

4. **Mythologically coherent** - We're not just selling software, we're building a world
5. **Multi-layered GTM** - Enterprise + Developer + Creator + Researcher + Student
6. **Regulated-industry ready** - Built for banks, healthcare, government from day one
7. **Open research** - We publish, we teach, we invite the world in
8. **Commerce + SaaS + Services** - Multiple revenue streams, defensible moat
