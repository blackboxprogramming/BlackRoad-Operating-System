# ==============================================================================
# ⚠️  CRITICAL WARNING - DO NOT USE THIS CONFIG IN PRODUCTION RAILWAY ⚠️
# ==============================================================================
#
# This railway.toml is for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING ONLY.
#
# ❌ DO NOT add "BlackRoad-Operating-System" as a Railway service
# ❌ DO NOT deploy this monorepo to production Railway environments
# ❌ DO NOT add this repo to service configurations or env vars
#
# ✅ CORRECT DEPLOYMENT MODEL:
#   - This repo is the SOURCE OF TRUTH (orchestration/sync only)
#   - Deploy ONLY the satellite repos to Railway:
#     • blackroad-os-core (from BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-os-core)
#     • blackroad-os-api (from BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-os-api)
#     • blackroad-os-operator (from BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-os-operator)
#     • blackroad-os-prism-console (from BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-os-prism-console)
#     • blackroad-os-docs (from BlackRoad-OS/blackroad-os-docs)
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS:
#   - Adding the monorepo to Railway will create circular deploy loops
#   - Environment variables will break (wrong service URLs)
#   - Cloudflare routing will fail
#   - Service dependencies will be misconfigured
#
# See: docs/os/monorepo-sync.md and DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
