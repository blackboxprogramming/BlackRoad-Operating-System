# Cognitive Layer - BlackRoad OS

## The Problem We're Solving

Every day, agents and humans struggle with:
- **Context fragmentation**: Information scattered across files, commits, docs, chats
- **Intent loss**: We forget WHY decisions were made
- **Document chaos**: Downloads folder anarchy
- **Knowledge silos**: Related info doesn't connect automatically
- **Coordination overhead**: Multi-agent/multi-human collaboration is messy

## The Vision

What if your OS actually understood what you're trying to accomplish? Not just files and folders, but **intent, context, and meaning**.

## Core Components

### 1. Intent Graph
Tracks goals, decisions, tasks, and their relationships. Every action has a "why" attached.

### 2. Semantic File System
Auto-organizes based on content and purpose. No more "hope the world doesn't catch on fire" file management.

### 3. Living Documents
Documents that are code-aware, self-updating, and understand their relationship to your project.

### 4. Context Engine
Provides exactly the information you need based on what you're trying to do right now.

### 5. Knowledge Weaver
Automatically connects related information across code, docs, tasks, and decisions.

### 6. Agent Coordination Protocol
Multi-agent collaboration that actually works - shared context, clear handoffs, no duplicate work.

### 7. Temporal Inspector
Understand how your system evolved and why - time-travel for decision making.

## Philosophy

- **Semantic over Hierarchical**: Organize by meaning, not arbitrary folder structures
- **Intent-Preserving**: Capture WHY, not just WHAT
- **Auto-Linking**: Related things connect automatically
- **Context-Aware**: The system knows what you're trying to do
- **Agent-First**: Designed for AI-human collaboration from the ground up

## Real-World Use Case: The Smart Document System

Imagine a doc editor that:
- Understands if it's a resume, business plan, technical spec, or meeting notes
- Automatically makes it ATS-friendly if it's a resume
- OCR scans and extracts structured data
- Auto-files itself based on project/purpose
- Links to related code, tasks, and decisions
- Formats itself correctly for the target audience
- Updates when linked code changes
- Suggests relevant templates based on intent

That's what we're building.
