# Accessibility Notes (v0.2)

- Added **contrastOS** theme for high-contrast users; theme manager cycles through three presets.
- Global command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + K) is keyboard navigable and labeled for screen readers.
- Desktop icons/start menu already expose `aria-label`/keyboard handlers; palette and new apps keep focusable controls.
- Notification Center shows focus modes to minimize interruption; quick batch actions reduce cognitive load.
- Remaining gaps: full keyboard traversal inside every app, color contrast audit across legacy apps, and screen reader labels for dynamic tables.
